# Rock, Paper, Scissors - Part One (5/24/23)

## The Challenge 
The goal of this project is to create a simple, five-round game of rock, paper, scissors between a player and a computer. 

## The Process
As it stands as on the day of writing this (5/24/23), my process so far has been refrencing the documentation provided by The Odin Project and other outside sources to familiarize myself with JavaScript. 

This project will be my first time writing a JavaScript program, so I have decided that it would be best to break the goals of this process down into managable chunks, and go from there. As it stands, my plan is this:
- [x] Write pseudocode to create an easy-to-follow guide.
- [x] First, work on a function that allows the computer to pick from three options, (rock, paper, scissors) and give those options values.
- [x] Create some sort of player input process (will require more documentation studying). 
- [x] ???
- [x] Profit.

I will update this as I progress through the project, cataloging more of my thoughts as I go.

**5/29/23 Update** - I finished! I had to seek out professional help and have them repeatedly explain the code to me like a child as we worked through it together, and I'm still not entirely sure how JavaScript works, but I feel like that is just part of learning a programming language. For now, until this project is brought up again later in The Odin Project's curriculum, it's done.
