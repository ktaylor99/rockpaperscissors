# Rock, Paper, Scissors - Part One (5/24/23)

## The Challenge 
The goal of this project is to create a simple, five-round game of rock, paper, scissors between a player and a computer. 

## The Process
As it stands as on the day of writing this (5/24/23), my process so far has been refrencing the documentation provided by The Odin Project and other outside sources to familiarize myself with JavaScript. 

This project will be my first time writing a JavaScript program, so I have decided that it would be best to break the goals of this process down into managable chunks, and go from there. As it stands, my plan is this:
- [ x ] Write pseudocode to create an easy-to-follow guide.
- [ ] First, work on a function that allows the computer to pick from three options, (rock, paper, scissors) and give those options values.
- [ ] Create some sort of player input process (will require more documentation studying).
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Profit.

I will update this as I progress through the project, cataloging more of my thoughts as I go.
